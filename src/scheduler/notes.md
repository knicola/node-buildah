# Notes

An attempt to replicate Laravel's scheduler in Node.js.

This is an old, unpublished, untested implementation. Recently modified for croner's newer versions.

- Should review and quite possibly refactor.
- Should add tests.
- Consider a functional approach for composition. If so, recreate class based approach using composition (?).
